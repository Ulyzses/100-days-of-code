# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
 - Added student page main cards in CDR and added dynamic content
 - Restructured code to better handle the announcements area

#### Thoughts
I think the design still needs work and so do the dynamic content but since I can see most of the content of the page now, I'm satisfied. Definitely need to speed things up, though.

#### Aim For Tomorrow
Fix the navbar and start on the teachers' page
