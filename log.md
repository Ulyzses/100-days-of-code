# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
 - Added student page main cards in CDR and added dynamic content
 - Restructured code to better handle the announcements area

#### Thoughts
Overall satisfied with how the challenge is going. The community on Twitter is great and were really supportive.

In terms of the project, I think the design still needs work and so do the dynamic content but since I can see most of the content of the page now, I'm satisfied. Definitely need to speed things up, though.

#### Aim For Tomorrow
 - Fix the navbar
 - Start on the teachers' page

### Day 2: 2 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
 - Designed database schema
 - Started on implementation of sort-by functionality in tables

#### Thoughts
Regarding the database schema, I'm not entirely sure if what I've done is good or bad. I haven't exactly worked with relational databases before and this is new experience. I did try to follow what I've read about normalisation so hopefully I got it or most of it correctly.

On the other hand, thought I did aim to fix the navbar and start the teachers' page, well, nothing really goes quite as planned. I ran out of time and decided to instead just implement a sort-by functionality in the tables. I thought it was easy at first after discovering MD Bootstrap, but turns out DataTables is an entire API. Not yet sure if I'm going to use/learn the API for my tables since it kinda messes up most of what I have right now, and blindly implementing it into the script would result in me cooking a fresh serving spaghetti code. Which leaves me with two options: learn the API and restructure my code or make my own sorting function. It might be like reinventing the wheel but in my opinion, it would be good for me to try to figure out things on my own as well. Besides, the API is too massive for such a small feat&mdash;much like using VS Code to open standalone .txt files.

Overall, not really satisfied with today's progress. I feel like I could've done much better than this. Still, I got to learn about a new API which I might need to revisit again in the future, which is a win.

#### Aim For Tomorrow
 - Finish sort-by functionality of tables (whether by DataTables or own code)
 - **Start on the teachers' page**

### Day 3: 3 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
Start on unfinished CS 11 exercises

#### Thoughts
Today, I didn't touch CDR at all, which was weird, to say the least. Anyway, doing this project, I felt slow and I didn't even manage to see it to completion today. This is very telling and I feel like I would be more productive if I speed things up without botching anything up.

#### Aim For Tomorrow
 - Finish bonus exercises
 - Continue CDR

### Day 4: 4 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
Finished CS 11 exercises

#### Thoughts
First time doing my own art in a project. It was pixel art and I figured I should start learning it to be able to create mine own programs (games, maybe in the future). Aside from that, nothing else really happened; everything was straightforward and I managed to finish them before the day ended.

#### Aim For Tomorrow
Continue CDR

### Day 5: 5 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
 - Fixed navbar
 - Implemented database schema
 - Restructured login backend
 - Added logout functionality
 - Added an about page template

#### Thoughts
As today progressed, I felt like I wasn't doing enough progress... until I decided to list them down and I actually had a decent amount of them. Well, quality is better than quantity but again, progress is still progress. I also started using task manager sites to help me organise the things I need to do and hopefully I'll be able to better monitor my activities then.

#### Aims For Tomorrow
 - Finish About page
 - Start on the profile pages

### Day 6: 6 January 2020

#### Today's Progress
 - Restructured student grades page
 - Implemented filter functionality to scores

#### Thoughts
I'm satisfied that I managed to implement the sorting functionality without needing to rely on an API. Also first time properly using the sort method since before it intimidated me. So far so good, I just hoped I'd speed up though.

#### Aim For Tomorrow
 - Create user registration page

### Day 7: 7 January 2020

####  Today's Progress
 - Changed student grades page to load subjects and announcements using PHP instead of Ajax calls
 - Created a functional registration page

#### Thoughts
Finally! I actually followed my prior aims. Been needing to get the registration done to tick things off of my list. I'd say it's worthwhile since I learned about SQL Inserts and a few caveats. I also feel great about the students page change because I learned about PHP functions that I didn't know before (spaceship operators and null coalescing operators).

#### Aim For Tomorrow
 - Finish registration page (middle name and birthday)
 - Set Login Cookies
